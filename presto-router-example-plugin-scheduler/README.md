# Presto Router Custom Scheduler Plugin

to be picked up by the presto-router
The scheduler name must be set to ``CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SCHEDULER`` in the router-config.json
    ``scheduler``: ``CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SCHEDULER``

The name of the custom scheduler factory must be set in the property file ``router-scheduler.properties`` in ``presto-router/etc/router-config``.
